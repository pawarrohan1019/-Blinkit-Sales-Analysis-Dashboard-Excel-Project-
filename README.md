# ðŸ›’ Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I created this **Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard** in Excel using **dummy data** to practice and showcase my data analysis and visualization skills.  
The purpose of this project was to design an **interactive dashboard** that gives business-style insights into **sales, outlets, products, and customer behavior**.  

I used Excel features like **Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, and KPIs** to make the dashboard easy to explore and understand.
